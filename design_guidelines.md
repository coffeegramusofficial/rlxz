## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile (<640px): Single column, stack cards vertically, touch-optimized buttons (min 44px)

- Desktop (>1024px): Full game board, side panels for stats/history

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **No Decorative Emojis:** Text interfaces, buttons, headers remain emoji-free
2. **Card Emojis:** ‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è for suits, ‚≠êüíéüëë for rarities (visual only, not interactive)
3. **Display Fixes:** Use CSS Grid for precise card alignment, Flexbox for dynamic spacing
4. **Performance:** Optimize card renders, use transform for animations (GPU acceleration)
5. **Accessibility:** High contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, clear focus states
